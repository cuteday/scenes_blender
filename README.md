# scenes_blender
commonly used (pbrt/mitsuba) scenes in blender format, for easy editing and conversion to other scene formats.

most scenes are obtained from [Benedikt Bitterliâ€™s rendering resources](https://benedikt-bitterli.me/resources/), and converted using the [mitsuba-blender](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba-blender) blender add-on. some of the scene exceeds the filesize limit of github (100mb) and are therefore compressed into .zip format.

check the LICENSE file in the scene folders to learn more about the restrictions of these scenes.
